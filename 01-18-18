Event 
	-Could be anything

Incident
	-A malicious event

Bug 
	-An error that exists in the implementation-level (i.e. only exist in source code); 
	very correctable

Flaw
	-An error at a much deeper level, particularly in the design, and likely in the
	code level; can be very difficult and costly to correct

Hacker 
	-A creative programmer; a positive connotation

Cracker
	-The bad guy, the attacker, what media coins "hacker" (the negative connotation). 
	We'll use attacker in this class.

Black hat 
	-An attacker with malicious intents

White hat 
	-An attacker with good intents (i.e., the white knight)

Gray hat 
	-An attacker with good and bad intents

Script kiddie or skiddie 
	-Nuisance; not going away any time soon; 1337 (i.e., elite) wannabes; use scripts 
	and exploits written by others and do not understand how they really work; always a lamer

Vulnerability 
	-A security bug (thanks Giovanni Vigna); a weakness in a system that can potentially 
	be exploited by an attacker

Exploiting or exploitation 
	-The act of taking advantage of a vulnerability

Exploit 
	-Software program that performs the exploiting

Risk 
	-The likelihood that an attacker will take advantage of that vulnerability

Threat 
	-The likelihood that an incident will happen

pwn3ed 
	-Owned; successful exploitation; computer system completely compromised

Zero day 
	-an undisclosed vulnerability that attackers can take advantage of. A zero-day attack happens 
	once that flaw, or software/hardware vulnerability, is exploited and attackers release malware 
	before a developer has an opportunity to create a patch to fix the vulnerability—hence “zero-day.”


						*******************************
						* Possible reasons for attack *
						*******************************

• Preventing enemies from communicating over network
• Steal information for attacker's benefit and get away with it
• Disruption of business, daily life, day-to-day operations
• Inserting information that "shouldn't be there”
• Destroy information, resources
• Gain access to a system and maintain access to system for a long time
• Monitoring people what they are doing (e.g., webcams)
• Challenging adversaries, pinpointing weaknesses
• For fun and profit (e.g., the black market)
• Spread propaganda
• Building a blueprint of weaknesses –and keep it for future reference


							***********************
							* What is Networking? *
							***********************

• Two or more computers talking to each other
• Basic definitions:
	• Client - A program running on your computer
		~Web browser - a client application that displays web pages (e.g., Chrome, Firefox,
		 Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, lynx)
	• Server - A computer running web server software on a remote computer; delivers 
	  information to other clients
		~Example: Apache HTTP Server
	• Internet – The world’s largest computer network
	• World Wide Web (or the “web”) - A collection of web sites, pages, and content around the world
	• Localhost - home; this computer
	• Socket - an endpoint instance defined by an IP address and a port in the context of either a 
	  particular TCP connection or the listening state.
	• Port - a virtualization identifier defining a service endpoint (as distinct from a service instance 
	  endpoint aka session identifier); a number



					*************************************
					* The Seven Layers of the OSI Model *
					*************************************

1. Physical - Lowest level, the bit level; primary role is communicating raw bit streams over physical 
   medium (e.g., Ethernet cable and card, "wires")
2. Data link - Transferring data between two points connected by a physical layer; provides high level 
   functions such as error correction and flow control (e.g., ARP, Ethernet)
3. Network – Middle ground; pass information between the lower and higher layers; provides addressing 
   and routing (e.g., IP, ICMP) --delivery is NOT guaranteed
4. Transport - Provides transparent and reliable transfer of data between systems, including acknowledgement 
   and segmentation (e.g., TCP, UDP)
5. Session - Establishes and maintains connections between network applications
6. Presentation - Allows for things like encryption and data compression (e.g., XML)
7. Application - The highest level interfaces, the services that you use on the Internet
	The famous and insecure ones by default, data all unencrypted:
		• DNS – Domain Name Server (DNS) -> Port 53
		• IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)
		• Email -> Port 143
		• FTP (File Transfer Protocol) • File transfer -> Port 21
		• HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) • The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web -> Port 80
		• Telnet • Protocol that allows you to connect to remote computers -> Port 21
		• POP (Post Office Protocol) • Email -> Port 110 • Current version is 3 thus protocol is now known as POP3
